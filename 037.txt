[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac environments sometimes need to be upgraded before they can be used 
in a new version of Trac. This document describes the steps necessary
to upgrade an environment.

== From 0.7.x to 0.8 ==

The database schema was changed between 0.7.x and 0.8. Existing environments
must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.8.

The following command will automatically perform the upgrade:
{{{
 $ trac-admin /path/to/projectenv upgrade
}}}

Trac environments are created with a default set of wiki pages. It's 
recommended to update these pages on existing environments whenever
Trac is upgraded to get up-to-date documentation and additional functionality.
The following command will perform the update:
{{{
 $ trac-admin /path/to/projectenv wiki upgrade
}}}
