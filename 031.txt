= Trac Logging =
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac supports logging of system messages using the standard ''logging'' module part of Python 2.3 and newer.

'''Note:''' If you are using a Python version older than 2.3, the Trac logging mechanism will be silently disabled.

Logging is configured in the {{{[logging]}}} section in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini].

== Python 2.2 Workaround ==
If you are using Python 2.2, however, note that the logging package from Python 2.3 works perfectly under 2.2 as well; you can just copy the entire {{{logging}}} directory from the Python 2.3 library into the Python 2.2 lib directory. Perhaps not the most elegant solution, but it works.


== Supported Logging Methods ==
 * '''none''' -- Suppress all log messages.
 * '''file''' -- Log messages to a file, specified with the ''log_file'' directive in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]. 
 * '''stderr''' -- Output all log entries to console ([wiki:TracStandalone tracd] only).
 * '''syslog''' -- (UNIX) Send messages to local syslogd via named pipe '/dev/log'.
 * '''winlog''' -- (Windows) Use the system's NT eventlog for Trac logging.

== Log Levels ==
The level of verbosity of logged messages can be set using the ''log_level'' directive in [wiki:TracIni trac.ini]. The log level defines the minimum level of urgency required for a message to be logged.

The levels are:
 * ''CRITICAL'' -- Log only the most critical, typically fatal, messages.
 * ''ERROR'' -- Request failures, bugs and errors. 
 * ''WARN'' -- Warnings, non-interrupting events.
 * ''INFO'' -- Diagnostic information, log information about all requests.
 * ''DEBUG'' -- Development messages, profiling, etc. Not fit for human consumption.
