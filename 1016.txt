 * Testing takes too long
   * Can we migrate partial mailboxes to speed up test cycle?
   * New erin account with small number of messages covering all necessary states, test migration on that
 * Migrated instance should be as close to erin as possible
   * No spam processing
     * Creates too many false positives
     * Need to work out exactly how to deliver messages into the system without invoking normal processing
