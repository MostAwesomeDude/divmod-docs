These are tickets that nobody in Divmod, Inc. proper is working on, but we'd love to see done for personal reasons.  Here are a few:

For finger exercises, you might want to attempt #398 and #399; these should be trivial but a good exercise for a beginner to find the right place to commit.  #400 isn't quite as simple, but it still shouldn't make your brain explode.  #324, a last updated attribute (or feature of the timestamp attribute type), also shouldn't be a huge amount of work.

Also on the easy side would be tickets like #3, detecting whether cookies can be set and doing something meaningful with that information.

We really need more ways to keep track of what's going on in an Axiom server.  #262 - upgrade status tracking - is a good example of a feature in that vein that's missing.

For those of you interested in database work, some challenging tickets: live queries that you can watch as they change, through the web: #161.  You could fix a highly subtle failure mode of the upgrade process, #301.  Or, you could implement proper nested transactions on top of Axiom's existing transaction support: #252.  Or support important missing parts of the relational model: add constraints: #366, or complex indices: #461, or the ability to join multiply against the same table: #453.
