From the ClickChronicle [http://clickchronicle.com/faq FAQ]

  1. What is ClickChronicle?
  ClickChronicle keeps a record of your web browsing and allows you to search all the web pages that you have visited.

  We are staring Alpha testing and would appreciate your help in shaking down any bugs and enhancing the product.

  The service is ''Firefox only'' and  has 2 parts: a click recorder and the clickchronicle.com service. The click recorder is a Firefox extension and can be installed by following the instructions below.

= Getting started =

 * Go to http://clickchronicle.com/signup
 * Enter your email address
 * Check your email for registration confirmation
 * Follow the link in the email to activate your account
 * Select a password
 * Click on 'My Clicks' in the navigation on the left hand side
 * Click on 'Get Extension'
 * Go through the 'Edit Options' > 'Allow' extension installation dance
 * Open a new browser window or tab
 * Notice the small ClickChronicle pause/record button in the Navigation Toolbar
 * When the extension is recording a pause button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.pause.png. Clicking on it will suspend the sending of clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * When the extension is paused a record button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.record.png. Clicking on it will start recording clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * By default, all recorded clicks are anonymously published and tallied on the front page. We encourage you to share you clicks since it makes the front page more useful and fun. However if you do not feel comfortable with anonymously publishing you clicks you can disable it by clicking on 'My account' and setting the 'Share Clicks (Anonymously) to 'No'.
 * Clicking on the button starts recording clicks to clickchronicle.com and displays 'CC On' on a dark blue background: http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.pause.png
