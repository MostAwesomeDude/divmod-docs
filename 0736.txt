If you're looking for a way to contribute to our open source efforts, thanks a lot!

[wiki:DivmodInc The Divmod company] would like our software to do anything and everything, but with a fledgling business to run, we have to make some tough choices with our time.  To help our feature ideas not get lost in the mists of time, we've just created a page of [wiki:CommunityGoals community goals]: a highlighted collection of tickets that we would be grateful if some brave soul in the open source world would attempt to contribute a patch for.

You can also contribute and show your appreciation by joining the [wiki:DivmodFanClub Divmod Fan Club].
