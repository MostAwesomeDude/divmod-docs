= Potato Programming =

'''One potato, two potato, three potato, four....'''

Potato programming is the sort of programming that encourages you to write your own 'for' loops and build up / tear down data structures, rather than passing vectors or iterators down through an interface in such a way that would allow a smarter version of that interface to be more efficient.

In other words, this is the PotatoProgramming way to add a file containing lines of numbers:

{{{
#!python
f = file('test.numbers')
accum = 0.
for line in f.readlines():
    accum += float(line)
print accum
}}}

Contrast this with:

{{{
#!python
f = file('test.numbers')
print sum(map(float, f.readlines()))
}}}

This term was coined by R0ml Lefkowitz.
