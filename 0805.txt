Mantissa is an application server.

It provides integration between the AxiomProject object database, and the TwistedFramework, as well as web user-interface utilities.

MantissaIsTheDeploymentTarget.

The goal of Mantissa is to provide a common platform that open-source contributors can use to help us build customized additions to the Divmod service.  Divmod is going to offer a variety of different services (starting with ClickChronicle), and if you want to write something that hooks into our network, Mantissa is how you do it.
