Medium-sized mammal of the family Hominidae in the order Primates, found
almost exclusively in the eastern portions of North America.  Jean-Paul is
non-migratory, but at times can be found several hundred miles from his
native habitat.  Jean-Paul's diet consists primarily of nuts and berries and
is supplemented by any of a number of caffeine-rich foods, such as coffee
beans and mountain dew.
