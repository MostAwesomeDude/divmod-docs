Epsilon is a small utility package; it depends on tools to recent for Twisted (like datetime in python2.4) but performs generic enough functions that it can be used in projects that don't want to share Divmods' other projects' large footprint.

Currently it includes a powerful date/time formatting and import/export class, for exchanging date and time information between all Python's various ways to interpret objects as times or time deltas, and some tools for managing concurrent asynchronous processes within Twisted.
