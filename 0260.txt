Currently the Divmod SIP stack is being developed in DivmodMantissa. 

Right now it features an [http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC3261/Output/ RFC3261] compliant SIP proxy, based on the transport and transaction layers described therein.

Things it is missing that we plan to add, in no particular order:

 * User agent client and server functionality. 
 * Dialog support.
 * an RTP proxy.
 * Third-party call control
