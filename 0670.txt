Radical is an interactive, 2D, isometric client/server game platform, delivered using nothing but a web browser, written using MantissaProject and Athena.

Seriously.  It actually does that.  You can move your little guy around on the screen, talk, and pick up items (there are even walls!)

It is still in the very early stages of development; there is a mostly-working demonstration in SVN, but there is no release, and few developer resources are being spent on it due to time and financial constraints.

If you find this interesting, please contribute!

= Running instructions =

Using an SVN checkout, run the following commands:

{{{
$ axiomatic -d radical.axiom mantissa
$ axiomatic -d radical.axiom start -n
}}}

then point your browser at <http://localhost:8080/>.  Log in as admin@localhost with the password you just specified.  Visit the 'Offerings' page and click the Radical area.  Visit the 'Signup' page and create a signup mechanism with the Radical benefactor.  Then signup for a Radical account using a working email address, follow the link that is emailed to your account, and start playing!
