== Part 1: Creating an Offering and Running it in a Mantissa Server ==

=== Create Project Skeletion ===
axiomatic project -n wiki

=== Set up Database and Mantissa Server ===
cd Wiki
axiomatic -d wikitut.axiom mantissa

=== Add a public page ===
The project skeleton's start page is designed to be viewed only by users who have a login for our mantissa server. We don't want to deal with the login system in this tutorial, so let's change the !WikiStart object to a !PublicPage in wiki/wiki_model.py.
 * Change ixmantissa.IPublicPage both in the 'implements' call and in the 'installOn' method
 * Remove the 'getTabs' and 'explode' methods and the registerAdapter line below the class
 * add the following method:
{{{
	def getResource(self):
	    return WikiView(self)
}}}

Because WikiStart is defined as powerup in our Offering(xmantissa/wikioff.py), an instance of this class will be added to our application store, when our app is added to the mantissa server.


=== Add Project to Mantissa Server ===
axiomatic -d wikitut.axiom start -n
Go to http://localhost:8080 and log in as admin
Navigate to Home->Offerings and click on the 'Wiki' offering to install it. If you can't see an offering named 'Wiki', your probably need to get your project dir onto your PYTHONPATH.
From now on our !WikiStart object can be viewed publicly at http://localhost:8080/Wiki. Unfortunately, we haven't written a nice view for our object, yet. This makes the Mantissa server display a nice backtrace.
