Radical is an interactive, 2D, isometric client/server game platform, delivered using nothing but a web browser, written using MantissaProject and LivePage.

Seriously.  It actually does that.  You can move your little guy around on the screen, talk, and pick up items (there are even walls!)

It is still in the very early stages of development; there is a mostly-working demonstration in SVN, but there is no release, and it is not being actively maintained due to lack of time.

If you find this interesting, please contribute!
