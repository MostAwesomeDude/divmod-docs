A Trac environment sometimes needs to be upgraded before it can be used with a new version of Trac. This document describes the steps necessary to upgrade an environment.

 '''Note''': ''Environment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases unless otherwise noted. For example, there's no need to upgrade a Trac environment created with (or upgraded) 0.8.0 when installing 0.8.4 (or any other 0.8.x release).''

== General Instructions ==

Typically, there are four steps involved in upgrading to a newer version of Trac:

=== Update the Trac Code ===

Get the new version of Trac, either by downloading an offical release package or by checking it out from the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/SubversionRepository Subversion repository].

If you have a source distribution, you need to run
{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

to install the new version. If you've downloaded the Windows installer, you execute it, and so on.

In any case, if you're doing a major version upgrade (such as from 0.8 to 0.9), it is ''highly'' recommended that you first remove the existing Trac code. To do this, you need to delete the `trac` directory from the Python `lib/site-packages` directory. You may also want to remove the Trac `cgi-bin`, `htdocs` and `templates` directories that are commonly found in a directory called `share/trac` (the exact location depends on your platform).

=== Upgrade the Trac Environment ===

Unless noted otherwise, upgrading between major versions (such as 0.8 and 0.9) involves changes to the database schema, and possibly the layout of the [wiki:TracEnvironment environment directory]. Fortunately, Trac provides automated upgrade scripts to ease the pain. These scripts are run via [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin]:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade
}}}

This command will do nothing if the environment is already up-to-date. [[BR]]

=== Update the Trac Documentation ===

Every [wiki:TracEnvironment Trac environment] includes a copy of the Trac documentation for the installed version. As you probably want to keep the included documentation in sync with the installed version of Trac, [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] provides a command to upgrade the documentation:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki upgrade
}}}

Note that this procedure will of course leave your `WikiStart` page intact.

=== Restart the Web Server ===

In order to reload the new Trac code you will need to restart your web server (note this is not necessary for plain old CGI, although CGI is discouraged for performance reasons).

== Specific Versions ==

The following sections discuss any extra actions that may need to be taken to upgrade to specific versions of Trac.

== From 0.8.x to 0.9 ==

If you're using [wiki:TracCgi CGI] you will want to update your `Alias` to the Trac htdocs static resources.  See the documentation on [wiki:TracCgi#MappingStaticResources mapping static resources] for an example on how to configure this.

[wiki:TracFastCgi FastCGI] and [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] users can safely remove any `Alias`es to the Trac htdocs folder since this is no longer used by default.

[wiki:TracModPython mod_python] users will also need to change the name of the mod_python handler in the Apache HTTPD configuration:
{{{
   from: PythonHandler trac.ModPythonHandler
   to:   PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend
}}}

If you have [http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite PySQLite] 2.x installed, Trac will now try to open your SQLite database using the SQLite 3.x file format. The database formats used by SQLite 2.8.x and SQLite 3.x are incompatible. If you get an error like ''“file is encrypted or is not a database”'' after upgrading, then you must convert your database file.

To do this, you need to have both SQLite 2.8.x and SQLite 3.x installed (they have different filenames so can coexist on the same system). Then use the following commands:
{{{
 $ mv trac.db trac2.db
 $ sqlite trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 trac.db
}}}

After testing that the conversion was successful, the `trac2.db` file can be deleted. For more information on the SQLite upgrade see http://www.sqlite.org/version3.html.

== From 0.7.x to 0.8 ==

0.8 adds a new roadmap feature which requires additional permissions. While a
fresh installation will by default grant ROADMAP_VIEW and MILESTONE_VIEW
permissions to anonymous, these permissions have to be granted manually when
upgrading:
{{{
 $ trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous MILESTONE_VIEW
 $ trac-admin /path/to/projectenv permission add anonymous ROADMAP_VIEW
}}}
