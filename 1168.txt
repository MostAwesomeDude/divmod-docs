[wiki:DivmodNevow/Athena/FAQ FAQ]

=== History ===

Athena is the best-of-breed approach to developing interactive javascript (AJAX / Comet) applications with DivmodNevow.  It should be noted that it '''supersedes''' previous solutions, such as livepage.  These prior solutions should not be used with Athena development.  Before using Athena, you may want to check out the [wiki:DivmodNevow/Tutorial Nevow tutorial].

=== Development Environment ===

If you haven't developed with !JavaScript before, you may wish to set up your development environment before beginning with Athena.  Some tips may be available, depending on your preferred tools:

 * [wiki:DivmodNevow/Athena/Emacs Emacs]
 * [http://www.getfirebug.com/ Firebug] - Firefox based javascript debugger

=== Testing ===

Visit the [wiki:DivmodNevow/AthenaTesting Testing Tutorial] or [http://blackjml.livejournal.com/21602.html Test Driven Development with Athena]

=== Implementation ===

Though Divmod's use of it predates the term by several years, Athena uses what some have come to call Comet.  Athena's !JavaScript half makes an HTTP request before it actually needs to retrieve information from the server.  The server does not respond to this request until it has something to tell the browser.  In this way, the server can push events to the browser instantly.
