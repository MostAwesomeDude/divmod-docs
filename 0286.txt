== Item ==
A class describing an object in an Axiom Store. Your subclass of axiom.item.Item must define the following attributes:
 * typeName: A string uniquely identifying this class schema in the store.
 * schemaVersion: An integer denoting the schema version. See [wiki:DivmodAxiom/Reference#Upgraders].
You will also want to define other attributes and these must be special Axiom class attributes. A selection of standard types are already defined in the [http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/Axiom/axiom/attributes.py axiom.attributes] module.
A simple example:
{{{
class Person(axiom.item.Item):
    typeName = 'Person'
    schemaVersion = 1

    name = attributes.text()
    age = attributes.integer()
    dob = attributes.timestamp()
}}}

 * [http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/Axiom/axiom/item.py class axiom.item.Item]

== Powerup ==
A powerup is a type of Axiom plugin. Zero or more powerups (Axiom items) can be registered to another axiom item (as long as it is in the same store) and can be retrieved according to their interface, either by normal adaption of the subject (in which case the highest priority powerup is returned), or as a group (in order of priority) by using the axiom.item.Item.powerupsFor method.

== Store ==
A database that Axiom Items can be stored in.
 * [http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/Axiom/axiom/store.py class axiom.store.Store]

== Substore ==
A Store that also exists as an Item in a parent Store.
