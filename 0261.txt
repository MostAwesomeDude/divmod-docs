= What does it mean to 'Merge a Branch Forward'? =

Merging forward is a way to keep old branches fresh and up-to-date.  It consists of this process:

  * Make sure your trunk working copy is clean
  * Make sure all your existing branch changes are checked in
  * Unbranch your existing branch.  eg, for sprocket-212, you would execute:
{{{
chbranch Divmod yourname/sprocket-212
unbranch Divmod
}}}
  * Resolve any conflicts and use 'svn resolved'
  * Create a new branch.  eg:
{{{
mkbranch Divmod yourname/sprocket-212-2
}}}
  * Commit the new branch.
  * Make sure to revert trunk by changing to trunk and issuing:
{{{
svn revert . -R
}}}
