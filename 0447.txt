= ClickChronicle Beta =
  Welcome intrepid Divmod fan!
  We hope you enjoy our latest offering.

== Disclaimer ==
  This is beta software and it may break. We have tested the software, but during the beta period we may have to restart the service erasing your account and data. We will do our best to avoid this but you have been warned.

= Overview =

From the ClickChronicle [http://clickchronicle.com/faq FAQ]

  1. What is ClickChronicle?
  ClickChronicle keeps a record of your web browsing and allows you to search all the web pages that you have visited.

  We are in our beta period and would appreciate your help in shaking down any bugs and enhancing the product.

  The service is ''Firefox only'' and  has 2 parts: a click recorder and the clickchronicle.com service. The click recorder is a Firefox extension and can be installed by following the instructions below.

= Getting started =

 * Go to http://clickchronicle.com/signup
 * Enter your email address
 * Check your email for registration confirmation
 * Follow the link in the email to activate your account
 * Select a password
 * Click on 'My Clicks' in the navigation on the left hand side
 * Click on 'Get Extension'
 * Go through the 'Edit Options' > 'Allow' extension installation dance
 * Open a new browser window or tab
 * Notice the small ClickChronicle pause/record button in the Navigation Toolbar
 * When the extension is recording a pause button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.pause.png. Clicking on it will suspend the sending of clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * When the extension is paused a record button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.record.png. Clicking on it will start recording clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * By default, all recorded clicks are anonymously published and tallied on the front page. We encourage you to share you clicks since it makes the front page more useful and fun. However if you do not feel comfortable with anonymously publishing you clicks you can disable it by clicking on 'My account' and setting the 'Share Clicks (Anonymously) to 'No'.
 * Once you have switched click recording on you should visit a few sites and then go to clickchronicle to ensure that the clicks have got through.

= Bookmarking =

You can bookmark the current page to your ClickChronicle by dragging clicking on the following 'bookmarklet'. Drag the link named 'CC Bookmark' below to your browser toolbar and click it when logged in to CC and viewing a page. A link to that page will be saved to the Bookmarks section of your ClickChronicle and the page will be indexed for ClickChronicle search. Right now, clicking on the bookmarklet silently bookmarks the page; we will add tagging soon.
