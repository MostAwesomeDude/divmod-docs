I've begun work on this and when I post the patch I'll post up a small 'HOW-TO' about how to work this into an application, and what kind of behavior to expect from it. The basic idea is that it publishes INavigableElements from a certain URL to any user, authenticated or not. It could also function for the front page of applications. Any item in a store that can adapt as a resource can be published through this, the same way PrivateApplication works.

Differences from PrivateApplication:
- Serves from the same store, no matter who the user is
- The store won't be a user store
- The store will be an application store
