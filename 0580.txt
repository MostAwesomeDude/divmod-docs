= The Divmod Fan Club =

Do you use Divmod's code?

Do you have a poster of Exarkun on your wall?

Do you love our giant-killing chutzpah?

Has work you've done using a Divmod project made you fantastically wealthy,
such that you don't know what to do with all your extra disposable income?

''Now you know.''

== Huh What?! ==

Our developer community has approached us to express their appreciation of our work,
and to influence us to work on particular aspects of our product for the their benefit. 

We've created the Divmod Fan Club, or the 'DFC', to give those users a way
to pay back, and a way for us to very publicly say 'thank you!'.

== It's Awesome - Why should I sign up? ==

Conscience. Influence. Status.

=== Conscience ===

Simple: you give because you take.

=== Influence ===

Starting at PyCon 2006, the club will have monthly meetings over IRC where
Divmod will propose a group of open-source features to be prioritized.  Club
members will be allowed to vote on the order those features will be implemented
in.

Members will be allowed a number of votes corresponding to the number of
dollars per month that their membership costs, except Mithril members, who
receive a maximum of 250 votes each, or can instead choose to apply their
membership fees directly to the expense of implementing features of their
choice.

=== Status ===

Members of the club who sign up for one of our Divmod commercial services (such
as the soon-to-be-re-launched [http://divmod.com/ Divmod Mail]) will occasionally get special
treats, early access to new features, and extra goodies not available to the
general public.

Eventually they will also receive a 'badge' displayed next to their user-icon
in public areas.

Additionally, since we are currently using this club to beta-test our billing
system, members who sign up during the beta period (prior to the first day of
PyCon) will receive an 'arcanite alloy' bonus, and be allowed 5 additional
votes for their membership level during the first 3 meetings.  Members who are
currently subscribers to [http://divmod.com Divmod Mail] will additionally
receive this bonus indefinitely.

== Where does the money go? ==

Pay employees for time spent on community work that is not essential to Divmod's core business.
{{{
Until we have our first Club meeting we have selected documentation as the next community-focused task that we'll work on as resources permit.
This will be reviewed at the first Club meeting.
}}}

Hire some of our open source contributors and pay them.

Once that's done, we may send some of this money to open-source contributors to
our products whom we do not employ, and then, if we have hojillions of dollars
left over, start paying for development of features in software Divmod's code
depends upon, such as SQLite and Python.
