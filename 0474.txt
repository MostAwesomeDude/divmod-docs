== Intro or Why another document? ==

So you have found your way here, perhaps reading through the other pages on this wiki, following irc-logs and blog-postings and you are still uncertain what this talking about [wiki:DivmodMantissa Mantissa] and [wiki:DivmodAxiom Axiom] is and what this things can do for you? Or is it what you can do with them?

Probably we have a few things in common:

 * you havn't imbibed [http://www.python.org Python] from your's infancy - I'm an old C programmer, started with that kind of stuff nearly 25 years ago
 * but the language gripped you and maybe you even had physical contact with [wiki:TwistedFramework Twisted] and Nevow which are some sort of [wiki:DivmodMantissa Mantissa] foundations ( and/or inspiration?).
 * still technical terms and other slang sometimes produce (some) trouble, but in a dark meander of your brain there is something is nudging you that such a thing like a multi-protocol, objects manipulating ... application server is a too interesting thing to let it sink back into the net ocean
 * on the other hand you want to build an application and need to choose a tool for this job. ... You had your time with Zope, looked at other Python frameworks, observed Django and even Ruby on Rails. But they are/seem to be too web-orientated.
