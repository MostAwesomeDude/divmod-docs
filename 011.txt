== Trac Permissions ==
[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac uses a simple but flexible permission system to control what users can and can't access.

Permission privilegies are managed using the [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] tool.

Regular visitors, non-authenticated users, accessing the system are assigned the default 
role (''user'') named {{{anonymous}}}. 
Assign permissions to the {{{anonymous}}} user to set privilegies for non-authenticated/guest users.

In addition to these privileges users can be granted additional individual 
rights in effect when authenticated and logged into the system.

=== Available privileges ===

 * {{{TRAC_ADMIN}}}
 * {{{LOG_VIEW}}}
 * {{{FILE_VIEW}}}
 * {{{CHANGESET_VIEW}}}
 * {{{BROWSER_VIEW}}}
 * {{{TICKET_VIEW, TICKET_CREATE, TICKET_MODIFY, TICKET_ADMIN}}}
 * {{{REPORT_VIEW, REPORT_CREATE, REPORT_MODIFY, REPORT_DELETE, REPORT_ADMIN, REPORT_SQL_VIEW}}}
 * {{{WIKI_VIEW, WIKI_CREATE, WIKI_MODIFY, WIKI_DELETE, WIKI_ADMIN}}}
 * {{{MILESTONE_VIEW, MILESTONE_CREATE, MILESTONE_MODIFY, MILESTONE_DELETE}}}
 * {{{ROADMAP_VIEW, ROADMAP_ADMIN}}}
 * {{{TIMELINE_VIEW}}}
 * {{{SEARCH_VIEW}}}
 * {{{CONFIG_VIEW}}}

The {{{something_ADMIN}}} privileges are just shortcuts that can be used to grant a user all the ''something'' privileges in one go. Having {{{TRAC_ADMIN}}}
is like being {{{root}}} on a *NIX system, it will let you do anything you want.

=== Granting privileges ===

Currently the only way to grant privileges to users is by using the
{{{trac-admin}}} script. The current set of privileges can be listed
with the following command:

{{{
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission list
}}}

This command will let the user ''bob'' delete reports:

{{{
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob REPORT_DELETE
}}}

=== Permission groups ===

Permissions can be grouped together to form roles such as
''developer'', ''admin'', etc.

{{{
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer WIKI_ADMIN
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer REPORT_ADMIN
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer TICKET_MODIFY
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob developer
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add john developer
}}}

=== Default permissions ===

Granting privileges to the special user ''anonymous'' can be used to control
what an anonymous user can do before they have logged in.

In the same way, privileges granted to the special user ''authenticated'' will apply to any authenticated (logged in) user.
