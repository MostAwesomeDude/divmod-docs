= [wiki:WikiStart Divmod] : Combinator =

Combinator is a tool that Divmod Python programmers use to manage multiple branches of our software.  It integrates with Subversion.

It can be used to manage any number of branches with any number of projects.  It sets up your Python sys.path to point at the appropriate directories for the set of branches you are currently working on.

It is mainly of interest if you are checking code out of SVN: users of installed versions of Divmod software can probably ignore this project (for now).
