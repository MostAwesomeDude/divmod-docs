= Divmod Mail Help =

Divmod Mail (Dmail) is part of the Divmod service. The goal of Dmail is allow you to deal with your email as efficiently as possible. When viewing a message you can take one of the following actions:
 * Reply
 * Forward
 * Archive
 * Defer
 * Delete
 * Mark Spam

=== Reply & Forward ===
These should be familiar actions to email users.

=== Archive ===
Dmail encourages you to keep empty your inbox by acting on messages and moving them out of your Inbox. When you archive a message it is moved from your inbox into your archive where it is still available to be searched and read but will not clutter you inbox. Most messages will eventually end up in your archive.

=== Defer ===
Sometimes you don't have time to deal with an important messages right away. In these cases Dmail allows you to defer the message. When deferred a message is removed from your inbox and will reappear in your inbox at a later point in time. There is a duration selector next to the defer button that allows you to specify the length of time that the message will be absent from your inbox before reappearing. Messages that have been deferred can be viewed in the deferred view. Once a message reappears it will have a boomerang icon on it to remind you that this was a message that you deferred.

=== Delete ===
Deleting a message moves it out of your inbox into the trash. It will not show up in search. Once you empty the trash the message will be lost forever.

=== Mark Spam ===
Dmail has an integrated spam filter and this option allows you to tell the system that a particular message is unsolicited mail. Clicking this button will move the message from you inbox into the spam view.

== Dmail Modes ==

Dmail can be used in any combination of 3 modes:
 * TouchOnce
 * Classic
 * Enhanced

=== TouchOnce Mode ==
TouchOnce mode was inspired by the story of a high ranking executive at an international conglomerate who dealt with his huge volume of paper mail with the simple rule of touching each piece of mail once. Similar in method to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd Getting Things Done] system he'd either respond to it right away, file it in his archive, put in the trash and in rare occasions he'd defer the next step putting the mail in a desk drawer for later action.

In TouchOnce mode you are presented with a view that simply shows you the next message for you to deal with starting with the oldest message first. You have to deal with the current message before you are presented with the next. Once you act on a message by, say, archiving it the next message is presented.

=== Classic Mode ===
Classic mode presents you with a list of messages in you inbox as well as the message detail view. In this mode you can read and act on messages in any order.

=== Enhanced Mode ===
This mode allows you to select which list of messages to view in the message list by selecting various tags.
