Pre-conditions
==============
First, apply the patch from `#529`:trac: This makes zomne actually work.

Shared host with Apache
=======================
Then, if you are, like me, on a shared server with Apache, you've probably got Python, Twisted and Nevow installed locally.  Therefore, zomne will fail to start twistd. Change the the line in zomne.c that says::

    sprintf(scratch, 'twistd -oy %s &> %s/twistd.log', tacfile, basedir);

to::

    sprintf(scratch, '/path/to/twistd -oy %s &> %s/twistd.log', tacfile, basedir);

Build zomne and place it somewhere::

    gcc zomne.c -o /path/to/zomne

Furthermore, PYTHONPATH is probably not set either, so you'll have to make sure to set that manually. I do that in a shell script that wraps the zomne.cgi binary. You could also write a small C application for speed. Either way, place this shell script in your webroot's cgi-bin directory, as nevow.cgi::

    #!/bin/sh
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/myself/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages
    exec /path/to/zomne

If you have access to mod_rewrite in your .htaccess, place the following lines in webroot/.htaccess::

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^$ nevow.cgi [L]

Now you should be able to access your Nevow application as http://domain.tld

If using the included zomne.tac to test your installation, remember to add ``addSlash=True``, or Nevow will give you a 404. While that hows the install was successful, it's also nice to see that your HelloWorld outputs what's expected. :)
