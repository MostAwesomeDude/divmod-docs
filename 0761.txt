= Imaginary =

Imaginary numbers are so named not because they are fictitious, but because
they are along a different axis from real numbers.

Divmod Imaginary is a simulationist's take on the realm of role playing,
interactive fiction, and multiplayer dungeons.  It incorporates gameplay
features from each area while attempting to provide a richer environment
than is generally available from existing systems.

A simulation core.  Currently very raw.  Browse the [browser:trunk/Imaginary/imagination the source] or [query:status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&component=Imaginary active tickets].

== Pottery ==

Another simulation core.  Attempts to accomplish the same goals as Imagination.  These two will probably merge some day.  [browser:trunk/Imaginary/pottery Browse source]
