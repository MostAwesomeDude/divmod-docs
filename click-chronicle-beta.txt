= ClickChronicle Beta =
  Welcome intrepid Divmod fan!
  We hope you enjoy our latest offering.

== Disclaimer ==
  This is beta software and it may break. We have tested the software, but during the beta period we may have to restart the service erasing your account and data. We will do our best to avoid this but you have been warned.

== Requirements ==
  '''ClickChronicle click recording currently only works with Firefox'''. The ClickChronicle experience is currently optimized for Firefox. You can view and search your clicks using most other browsers including Internet Explorer and Opera, however some pages may look a little strange.

= Overview =

From the ClickChronicle [http://clickchronicle.com/faq FAQ]

  1. What is ClickChronicle?
  ClickChronicle keeps a record of your web browsing and allows you to search all the web pages that you have visited.

  We are in our beta period and would appreciate your help in shaking down any bugs and enhancing the product.

  The service is ''Firefox only'' and  has 2 parts: a click recorder and the clickchronicle.com service. The click recorder is a Firefox extension and can be installed by following the instructions below.

= Getting started =

 * Go to http://clickchronicle.com/signup
 * Enter your email address
 * Check your email for registration confirmation
 * Follow the link in the email to activate your account
 * Select a password
 * Click on 'My Clicks' in the navigation on the left hand side
 * Click on 'Get Extension'
 * Go through the 'Edit Options' > 'Allow' extension installation dance
 * Open a new browser window or tab
 * Notice the small ClickChronicle pause/record button in the Navigation Toolbar
 * When the extension is recording a pause button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.pause.png. Clicking on it will suspend the sending of clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * When the extension is paused a record button will display http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ext.record.png. Clicking on it will start recording clicks to ClickChronicle.
 * By default, all recorded clicks are anonymously published and tallied on the front page. We encourage you to share you clicks since it makes the front page more useful and fun. However if you do not feel comfortable with anonymously publishing you clicks you can disable it by clicking on 'My account' and setting the 'Share Clicks (Anonymously) to 'No'.
 * Once you have switched click recording on you should visit a few sites and then go to ClickChronicle to ensure that the clicks have got through.

= Click actions =
When viewing clicks you will see a number of icons in the 'Actions' column on the right hand side of that clicks list.

 http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ccicons/bookmark.png - Clicking on this icon will bookmark the click. It will now appear in the Bookmarks section of your ClickChronicle. Unlike normal clicks that eventually get forgotten, bookmarks are stored permanently. Once a click has been bookmarked the bookmark icon will be grayed-out.

 http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ccicons/delete.png - Clicking on this icon will delete the click/domain/bookmark. This action is immediate, permanent and can not be undone.

 http://divmod.org/users/amir/screenshots/ccicons/ignore_link.png - Clicking on this icon will first delete all clicks to the ''domain'' of the click and will ignore all subsequent clicks to this ''domain''. This is useful for ignoring domains that are either repetitive, have no useful content for later search or you simply don't want to be stored and anonymously reported. Once a click or domain has been ignored the icon will be grayed-out.

 Unblocking blocked domains is currently a little involved and unintuitive: to unblock a domain, find it in the domain browser and delete it. Clicks to the domain will no longer be ignored. We will soon add a blocked-domain browser to ease this task.

= Bookmarking =

You can bookmark the current page to your ClickChronicle by dragging clicking on the following 'bookmarklet'. Drag the link named 'CC Bookmark' below to your browser toolbar and click it when logged in to CC and viewing a page. A link to that page will be saved to the Bookmarks section of your ClickChronicle and the page will be indexed for ClickChronicle search. Right now, clicking on the bookmarklet silently bookmarks the page; we will add tagging soon.

>CC Bookmark</a>
}}}

= Your clicks and the ClickChronicle front page =

Your clicks get anonymously posted to the ClickChronicle front page. There is no way for anyone (not even the Divmod team) to know which clicks on the front page came from which user. Note that each URL that you visit is only posted once to the front page in a 24 hour period. Clicks will not get posted to the front page in the following circumstances:
 * You have paused click recording in Firefox (see Getting Started section above)
 * You have selected to disable anonymous click sharing in your preferences
 * You have chosen to ignore clicks for the domain you are visiting (see Click Actions section above)
 * You have already visited an URL once during a 24 hour period

Note that even when clicks are not posted to the front page, the click count is incremented.
