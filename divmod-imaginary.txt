= Divmod: Imaginary =

Imaginary numbers are so named not because they are fictitious, but because
they are along a different axis from real numbers.

Divmod Imaginary is a simulationist's take on the realm of role playing,
interactive fiction, and multiplayer dungeons.  It incorporates gameplay
features from each area while attempting to provide a richer environment
than is generally available from existing systems.

Status: Imaginary is currently on the back of some peoples' minds.
