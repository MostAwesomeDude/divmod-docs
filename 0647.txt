= [wiki:WikiStart Divmod] : Democracy Server =

In keeping with our commitment to the Open in Open Source, Divmod is
readying our Quotient conversation server to be the foundation for another
important application-- the Democracy Server. The Democracy Server is a
piece of open source software that can be deployed in cities, small towns and
villages to provide email, telephony, publishing, voting, auction and
[http://www.nexuspub.com/articles/2003/july2003/interview.htm complementary currency] facilities for the community. We believe that our tool will
encourage participatory democracy and facilitate beneficial markets and provide the
transparency needed to keep markets open and democracies viable.

Using our Quotient to Quotient protocol (Q2Q) we can network Democracy
Servers and provide a mechanism for trading, communicating and voting
on regional and/or national levels.
