I write computer programs for Divmod, from a third-floor apartment in Cape Town, South Africa.
I like building things and seeing them come togther; I tend to
gravitate towards the implementation of tangible, user-facing features.
Just about all of the interesting things about me don't have a place in a
corporate personnel blurb, so I'll instead say something about enjoying reading
books and listening to music.  I don't watch anime or read web comics, although
I do enjoy playing computer games, but don't maintain a blog.
