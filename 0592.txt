= Divmod Fan Club Mithril Membership =

Mithril membership is designed for corporations and opens the door to Divmod's professional services:

 * Support
 * Training
 * Consulting

Mithril should be viewed as a retainer and engagements are priced on a
case-by-case basis.

== Support ==

Divmod offers in-depth support for our products that can be escalated
to the original developers. Divmod support is priced according to the
level of support needed and the expected response-time.

== Training ==

Divmod offers training workshops for software engineers and architects
interested in a hands-on experience with our products. Classes can
range for one-day single-product overviews to multi-day classes
covering the whole Divmod and Twisted software stack.

== Consulting ==

Divmod consulting will help you to design, build, tune and deploy
reliable, high-performance Divmod-based solutions. Our consulting team
offers technical assistance in consulting engagements that can provide
the knowledge transfer and expertise to allow you to complete your
projects on-time and on-budget. Our team is extremely productive with
our software and can deliver non-trivial applications in a matter of
weeks.
