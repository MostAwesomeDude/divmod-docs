= Trac Backup =
Since Trac uses a database backend, it requires some extra care to safely create a backup of a TracEnvironment. Luckily, TracAdmin has a command to make backups easier - '''hotcopy'''.

'''Note:''' Trac uses the ''hotcopy'' nomenclature to match that of [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], to make it easier to remember when managing both Trac and Subversion servers.

== Creating a Backup ==
To create a backup of a live TracEnvironment, simply run:
{{{
  $ trac-admin /some/where/mytracenv hotcopy /my/vault/mytracenv-backup
}}}

'''Note:''' TracAdmin will lock the database while copying.

The resulting backup copy is safe to handle using standard file-based backup tools like tar or dump/restore.


=== Restoring a Backup ===
Backups are simply a copied snapshot of the entire TracEnvironment directory structure, including the SQLite database. 

To restore an environment from a backup, simply shut down your Trac service (Web server or tracd), restore the directory structure from backup and restart the service.
