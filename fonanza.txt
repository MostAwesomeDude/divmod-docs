Fonanza is a community for the provision and consumption of services.

The focus is services that can be delivered online over chat or voice.

Typical services include system administration, technical support, language instruction, talk therapy and adult chat/phone.

Service providers and consumers have a reputation.

A person may have several service provider personalities each with its own reputation.

Services are exchanged for a fee. The fee can be very low when a provider is building their reputation.

Services may have an introductory offer e.g. 5 minutes free for language instruction.
