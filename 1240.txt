= Mantissa Plugin Notes =

== Overview ==

This page is a collection of notes based on my adventures with the following tickets:
 * #911
 * #2530
 * #2531

As such, you can imagine the following about these notes:
 * they are based on one specific aspect of Mantissa/Axiom plugins;
 * they are written from a relative Noob perspective; and
 * are most certainly not complete.

The plugin under scrutiny here (well, under rewrite, actually) is {{{axiomatic project}}} which has been (until some time in the near future) called in the following manner:
{{{
axiomatic project -n MyApp
}}}
This creates a Divmodâ„¢-approved directory structure populated by minimally functional code stubs, ready for the project dev to start making '!MyApp' a software reality.
