Divmod Quotient is a messaging platform developed as an Offering for Divmod
Mantissa.

It is currently in the very early stages of development, but you can already
use it to read your mail.

(Divmod, Inc. is planning to offer a commercial service based on Quotient in
the near future.  Watch http://divmod.org/ for an announcement!)
