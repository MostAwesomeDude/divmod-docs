= Getting Started With Mantissa =
Here I will describe how to write a simple Mantissa app.
== Get Mantissa and Dependencies ==
 * Install Zope Interfaces and Twisted if you have not already done so.
 * Setup Mantissa - You don't need to *install* the Divmod infrastructure you just need to make sure that all the modules are on your python path. The simplest way to set everything up for development is to use Combinator, which will download everything and setup your PATH and PYTHONPATH. See [wiki:DivmodCombinator/Examples/QuickStart Combinator Quickstart] then switch to the trunk branch.
 * Test - If you have set everything up correctly you should now be able to run the following commands and see similar output

== Create Project Structure ==

 * ./KBase/axiom/plugins/kb.axiomaticcmd.py
 * ./KBase/xmantissa/plugins/kb.theme.py
== Axiomatic Application Commander == 
Before we can start writing our app, we need a way of installing it into an axiom database, so first lets look at the axiomatic command plugin.
