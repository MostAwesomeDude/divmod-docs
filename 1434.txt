!PyFlakes a Lint-like tool for Python, like [http://pychecker.sourceforge.net PyChecker].  It is focused on identifying common errors quickly without executing Python code.

Its primary advantage over [http://pychecker.sourceforge.net PyChecker] is that it is ''fast''.  You don't have to sit around for minutes waiting for the checker to run; it runs on most large projects in only a few seconds.

The two primary categories of defects reported by !PyFlakes are:

  * Names which are used but not defined or used before they are defined
  * Names which are redefined without having been used

These can each take many forms.  For example, !PyFlakes will tell you when you have forgotten an import, mistyped a variable name, defined two functions with the same name, shadowed a variable from another scope, imported a module twice, or two different modules with the same name, and so on.
