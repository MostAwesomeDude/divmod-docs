Enhancements to the Python bindings for the [http://www.xapian.org Xapian] full-text indexing library.

While Xapian comes with bindings, they are hard to work with, and being SWIG'd, a literal translation of a C++ API.  Xapwrap simplifies working with Xapian databases in Python.

This is implemented as a second layer of wrapping, so Xapian's bindings are still required.

Divmod uses Xapian (and Xapwrap) for of our products' full-text indexing needs.
