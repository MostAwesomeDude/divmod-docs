= !PyFlakes =
is a Lint-like tool for Python, like [http://pychecker.sourceforge.net PyChecker].  It is focused on identifying common errors quickly without executing Python code.

Its primary advantage over [http://pychecker.sourceforge.net PyChecker] is that it is ''fast''.  You don't have to sit around for minutes waiting for the checker to run; it runs on most large projects in only a few seconds.
