Pyndex

The Pyndex project has been RETIRED! For full-text indexing and search we
recommend [wiki:DivmodXapwrap Divmod Xapwrap] or
[http://pylucene.osafoundation.org/ PyLucene] instead.

Pyndex is a simple and fast full-text indexer (aka search engine) implemented
in Python. It uses Metakit as its storage back-end. It works well for quickly
adding search to an application, and is also well suited to in-memory indexing
and search. It performs best in applications involving a few thousand
documents. Pyndex can handle AND, OR and phrase queries.
