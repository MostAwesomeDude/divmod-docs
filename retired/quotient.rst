==============
'Old' Quotient
==============

Quotient's name lives on but the original ATOP-based Quotient is now known as
Old Quotient. The latest version of [DivmodQuotient Quotient] is based on
[DivmodAxiom Axiom]: our 'smart' database.

The short version is: Quotient has been ported to Axiom and (the new)
Mantissa. We have been supporting and will continue to support our existing
customer base that uses 'Old' Quotient -- never fear :-) We are also
investigating potential integration with our [http://blendix.com Blendix]
service, so stay tuned!
