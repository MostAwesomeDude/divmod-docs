Divmod Xapwrap
==============

This project is no longer supported.  It is not compatible with the latest
release of Xapian.

Enhancements to the Python bindings for the [http://www.xapian.org Xapian]
full-text indexing library.

While Xapian comes with bindings, they are hard to work with, and being
SWIG'd, a literal translation of a C++ API.  Xapwrap simplifies working with
Xapian databases in Python.

This is implemented as a second layer of wrapping, so Xapian's bindings are
still required.
