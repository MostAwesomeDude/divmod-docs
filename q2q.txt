= Q2Q =

is a protocol for:
 * opening authenticated connections, even through NAT
 * allowing a user to reliably demonstrate their identity (for distributed authentication)
 * receiving real-time data directly from other users

Q2Q provides a mechanism for a user to decide whether they want to expose their IP address to a third party *before* accepting a peer-to-peer connection.

It is byte-stream oriented and application-agnostic.  Any peer-to-peer application can use Q2Q to open connections and deliver messages.

VertexProject is the Divmod implemention of Q2Q
