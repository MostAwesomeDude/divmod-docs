= So You Want To Change Your Schema =

This is a very brief overview of how to write upgrade tests for Axiom.  I hope someone else will clean it up and add more information.  This assumes familiarity with Axiom, Divmod project layout, trial unit tests, Combinator, and probably a dozen other things.

In order to understand the following you will need to look at these two modules: {{{axiom.test.historic.stub_catalog1to2}}} and {{{axiom.test.historic.test_catalog1to2}}}

== Do Stuff ==

 1. write a file like stub_catalog1to2.py in your project's {{{tests/historic}}} directory, named appropriately for your object and versions.  This is written using the __old__ API, the one present in trunk before your branch is merged.
 1. the number in the call to saveStub is the revision of $COMBINATOR_PROJECTS/Divmod/trunk when you are writing the upgrader.
 1. 
{{{
% cd ~/Divmod/branches/foo-19191919/Foo/foo/test/historic/
% chbranch Divmod trunk
% python stub_foo1to2.py # this will create a file called 'foo1to2.axiom.tbz2'.
% svn add foo1to2.axiom.tbz2
}}}
 1. write test_account1to2.py, and it works like a regular trial test, except for loading your stub database automatically.
