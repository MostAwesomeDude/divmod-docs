Mantissa is an application server. It provides integration between the [wiki:DivmodAxiom Axiom] 'smart' object database, the [wiki:DivmodNevow Nevow] web templating/AJAX/COMET framework and the TwistedFramework.

MantissaIsTheDeploymentTarget.

The goal of Mantissa is to provide a common platform that open-source contributors can use to help us build customized additions to the Divmod service.  Divmod is going to offer a variety of different services, and if you want to write something that hooks into our network, Mantissa is how you do it.
