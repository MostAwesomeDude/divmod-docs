== Lupy ==

The Lupy project has been RETIRED! For full-text indexing and search we recommend [wiki:DivmodXapwrap Divmod Xapwrap] or [http://pylucene.osafoundation.org/ PyLucene] instead.

Lupy is a is a full-text indexer and search engine written in Python. It is a port of Jakarta Lucene 1.2 to Python. Specifically, it reads and writes indexes in Lucene binary format. Like Lucene, it is sophisticated and scalable. Lucene is a polished and mature project and you are encouraged to read the documentation found at the Lucene home page.

Lupy requires Python 2.3 or greater.
